You are solving a complex question by recursive decomposition with retrieval.

Question: {question}

{context_section}

You have two options:
1. Answer directly if the question is simple enough given the available context.
   Format: DIRECT: <your answer>
   IMPORTANT: The answer must be SHORT and EXTRACTIVE — just the answer itself with no explanation or reasoning. For example: "yes", "Paris", "42", "Albert Einstein".

2. Decompose into sub-questions that can be answered independently, then combined.
   Format:
   DECOMPOSE:
   - SUB: <sub_question_1>
   - SUB: <sub_question_2>
   COMBINE: <instruction for how to combine the sub-answers into a final answer>

Guidelines:
- Prefer DIRECT when the context already contains the answer or the question is simple.
- Use DECOMPOSE when the question requires multiple pieces of information that can be found separately.
- Sub-questions should be self-contained and answerable independently.
- Keep the number of sub-questions small (2-4 is ideal).
- The COMBINE instruction should clearly explain how to merge sub-answers.
- For yes/no questions, always prefer DIRECT with just "yes" or "no".

OUTPUT:
